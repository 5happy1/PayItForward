# PayItForward

An app that centers around the pay it forward concept. A user does a good deed, captures it in this app, and tags up to 3 other users to do another good deed and share it. They create chains of actions, continually tagging others. 

Right now this app is very much a concept, but has a working backend for user registration & login.
